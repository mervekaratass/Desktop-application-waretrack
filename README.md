# Desktop-application-waretrack
Waretrack is one of the applications that businesses can use while tracking their warehouses. Visual Studio 2019 was used while programming the application. The C# form was chosen as the language because it has form elements that will provide good interaction with the user. Microsoft SQL Server 2019 was used as the database. In the application, businesses will log in to the system by registering. After logging in, you can see products, reports, material receipts, sales and purchasing waybills; can add, subtract and delete above them. They can sign out from the sign out section. Thus, it is aimed to facilitate the tracking of the goods in the warehouse of an enterprise.
